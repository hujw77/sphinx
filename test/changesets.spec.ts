/**
 * We use the Changesets package to generate release versions which requires that we manaully determine when to do
 * releases and for which packages. There are some cases where we can accidentally do a release incorrectly that could
 * result in user either not getting changes that they should get based on the plugins package version they have
 * installed, or that in the worst case could break their installation.
 *
 * We use this test suite to enforce some basic rules that prevent this from happening:
 * 1. If we make a release for core or contracts, we must also make a release for plugins. This ensures we never release
 * a change to core or contracts that won't automatically be reflected in the latest version of the plugins package.
 *
 * 2. The release type severity should always follow the order: contracts >= core >= plugins. This means that if we are
 * going to do a minor release for plugins, we have to also do a minor release for core, if there are any changes in core.
 *
 * This prevents the following case:
 * We ship a patch change to core that is a breaking change in plugins (i.e changes an interface that plugins relies on),
 * then ship a minor change for the plugins package. This would break the plugins package for people who are installing
 * a previous version without a lock file. This would happen b/c they would get the latest patch change in core, but would
 * not have the latest minor change to plugins. So the update to core would be incompatible with the update to plugins.
