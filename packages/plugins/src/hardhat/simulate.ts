 * 1. Running the simulation with Hardhat allows us to reuse the TypeScript logic that executes the

 * Solidity. Also, adding complex Solidity logic to the Sphinx plugin contracts can lead to
 * unpredictable IR compilation failures.
 *
 * 2. Running the simulation with Hardhat allows us to accurately calculate the gas used by the
 * deployment, which determines the estimated cost that we provide to the user. The estimate is
 * more accurate with Hardhat because we're able to use the `gasUsed` field of the transaction
 * receipts instead of relying on the `gas` field of Foundry's transaction responses. The latter
 * gives estimates that are anywhere between 35-55% higher than the actual gas used because it
 * uses `eth_estimateGas` under the hood.
 *
 * 3. It's non-trivial to pass a very large Merkle tree from TypeScript to Foundry. Particularly,
 * `spawn` is prone to input size limits, and EthersJS can't ABI encode extremely large amounts
 * of data (i.e. it'll fail for a Merkle tree that contains 250 contract deployments, where the
 * contract is near the maximum size limit).

    // 1. We only ran into this error when creating an Anvil node with Ethereum's chain ID, but it
    //    may also occur on other popular networks.

    //    config's `hardfork` option as well as its `chains.hardforkHistory` option. Neither

    // 3. This error is only thrown when hardcoding the block number in the Hardhat config. When we
