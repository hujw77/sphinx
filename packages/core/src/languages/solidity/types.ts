/**
 * Represents a deployment that was executed on a network. It includes detailed information about
 * the deployment such as transaction receipts, configuration settings, and relevant contract
 * addresses.
 *
 * @property {string} _format The format of the execution artifact.
 * @property {Array<{response: SphinxTransactionResponse, receipt: SphinxTransactionReceipt}>}
 * transactions - This array includes each transaction response with its receipt, sorted in
 * ascending order chronologically. For new Gnosis Safe deployments, the first transaction deploys
 * the Safe, the second approves the deployment, and the rest execute the deployment. For existing
 * Safes, the first transaction approves the deployment, and the rest execute the deployment.
 * @property {string} merkleRoot - The Merkle root of the deployment.
 * @property {Array<string>} solcInputHashes - The full list of Solidity compiler hashes used for
 * the deployment.
 * @property {string} safeAddress - The address of the Gnosis Safe.
 * @property {string} moduleAddress - The address of the Sphinx Module.
 * @property {string} executorAddress - The address of the executor.
 * @property {string} nonce - The nonce.
 * @property {string} chainId - The chain ID.
 * @property {Array<SphinxTransaction>} actions - An array of Sphinx transactions, which are the
 * encoded inputs to the deployment.
 * @property {Object} sphinxConfig - The configuration options in the deployment script along with
 * the configuration options for the Gnosis Safe that executed the deployment.
 * @property {ExecutionMode} executionMode - Whether the deployment was executed on a local network
 * via the CLI, on a live network via the CLI, or via the DevOps Platform.
 * @property {Object} initialState - On-chain state variables that were recorded before the
 * deployment was executed.
 * @property {Array<Object>} unlabeledContracts - An array of contracts Sphinx couldn't find an
 * artifact for. These contracts won't be verified on block explorers, and Sphinx will not create a
 * deployment artifact for them. If a contract does not have a source file, it will be in this
 * array. Common examples are minimal `CREATE3` or `EIP-1167` proxies.
 * @property {boolean} arbitraryChain - Indicates whether the deployment can be executed on an
 * arbitrary chain. Currently always false.
 * @property {Array<string>} libraries - An array of libraries that were used in the deployment.
 * These are in the format that the Solidity compiler expects. For example,
 * `path/to/file.sol:MyLibrary=0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890`.
 * @property {string} gitCommit - The full git commit hash on the machine that initiated the
 * deployment. If the deployment was executed via the DevOps Platform, this is recorded on the
 * machine that proposed the deployment. If the deployment was executed from the user's local
 * machine instead of the DevOps Platform, this is recorded on the user's machine when they run the
 * `deploy` CLI command. This is null if the repository was not a git repository when the deployment
 * was initiated.
 * @property {string} safeInitData - The raw data that deployed and initialized the Gnosis Safe.
 * This is null for deployments that use a previously deployed Gnosis Safe.

 * element in the `history` array will be the first deployment, the second element in the array will
 * be the second deployment, and the top-level artifact will be the most recent deployment.
